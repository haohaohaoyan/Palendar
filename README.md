# Palendar
An AI-powered calendar, designed to be accessible, easy to understand and use, and simple to integrate into your daily life. Our goal is to help those who may struggle to plan events or remember things and get them back on the right track without making it hard, technologically demanding, or expensive. Originally a submission for the 2025 Congressional App Challenge, we plan to keep working on our project for the foreseeable future.

# WARNING!!

**While the AI functionality requires an API key, it is currently replaced with a placeholder for security concerns. We should have a working backend by the beginning of next year, although that's not guaranteed.**

## Features

* Event creation and editing
* AI planning assistant
* Notepad 
* *in testing, theoretically works* Daily event reminders

## Future planned features

* A functioning backend to handle the AI responses instead of running everything in the frontend
* Proper testing for daily reminders
* State management for the AI that *actually works*
* More customization features, such as event colors and themes

## Release Timeline

### Beta Version

* V 1.0 (Current Version)
* V 1.2 (Backend implementation)
* V 1.6 (JS migration(Currently In Pyscript))
* V 2.0 (Redesign ???)

### Stable Version Coming Soon!

Our App is still in Beta testing, so there might be errors or unexpected results. We will continue to work on improving our user experiance under beta, and eventually release the stable version when its ready. Please do not hesitate in sending us feedback, it is valuable for us 😊.

## Open-source modules and libraries used

* Python modules
    * calendar
    * datetime
    * json
    * random
    * ast
* Pyscript
* Bootstrap
* Google Gemini SDK


## Roadblocks in development

* Time constraint (we only found out about the Challenge a month before it was due)
* Limited knowledge and not knowing much about Javascript, requiring using Pyscript to use Python in the browser
* Incompatibility issues with the Gemini SDK
* Nonexistent memory for the AI (State management is kinda finicky!)
* API security in the browser (Currently being fixed and should be done by the end of December 2025)
