# Palendar
AI-powered calendar and planning assistant (at least that's what they told me). Submission for 2025 Congressional App Challenge

Open-source modules and libraries used:
calendar, datetime, json, random, ast, Pyscript, Pyodide, Bootstrap, Google Gemini SDK

*API key not included yet. Will be adding a backend to the web version afterward. The main branch is open source and requires the user to provide one.
